			<p>Headphones cause damage to your ears the same way other loud noises do, resulting in what audiologists call “noise-induced hearing loss.” Over time the sounds from your headphones cause the hair cells in the cochlea to bend down too much or too severely. If they don't get time to recover, the damage can be permanent.</p>

		        <h3 class="section-title">Ways To Protect Your Hearing Health</h3>
		   <p>1. Your ears are responsible for transmitting and receiving
sounds, maintaining body balance, enhancing
healthy interpersonal relations with others, and so
much more. As important as they are, our ears require
special care. Here are some helpful tips on how to protect
your ears and keep them healthy.
<p>Clean your outer ears only: To keep the ears
clean, you only need to clean the outer parts. Clean with
water, gentle soap and a washcloth. Also wipe the outer
curves with cotton swabs.</p>	 
			
			<p>2. Never stick objects in your ears: A clean ear is
not wax-free. The ear is a self-cleaning organ, and is
designed to have some wax in it to prevent dust and
other possibly harmful substances from entering the
ears. Left alone, old earwax will naturally fall out due
to jaw movement. Do not stick cotton swabs, Q-tips,
sharp or pointed objects in your ear canal. Some of
these objects may push the earwax further in, rather
than removing it, and this may lead to blockage, ear
trauma, and hearing loss eventually. If there is a buildup
of earwax in your ear, seek professional help to have it
			removed.</p>
			
<p>3. Maintain a healthy diet: There are several
studies that show how diferent foods are crucial to
your hearing. The right kind of food will contribute to
your body’s immunity against age-related hearing loss,
so practice sound dietary habits today, with adequate
	fruits, vegetables, nuts and proteins. </p>
<p>4. Mind your meds: Some medications may cause
temporary or permanent hearing loss. Use medications
only as prescribed by a doctor, be sure to read up
on the side efects and watch out for any adverse reactions. Discontinue use and seek immediate medical
assistance if you observe hearing loss or develop
constant noise in your ears while on any medication.

			<br/>
			<br/>
			
		        
		        <p>5. Protect against infections: Moisture in the ear
canal and piercings in the earlobes are likely breeding
grounds for infection-causing bacteria. To protect
against these infections, always dry your ears with a
clean dry towel after showering or swimming. Routine
cleaning of ear piercings and earrings with rubbing
alcohol is also advised.</p>
		        <p>6. Avoid loud noise: The level of noise and duration
of exposure to it is a factor in hearing loss. To protect
your ears, we recommended using ear/headphones
for a maximum of one hour daily at 60% volume. Wear
hearing protection during exposure to loud levels of
noise while mowing the lawn, at a shooting range, at a
sporting event, etc.</p>
		        <p>7. Employ safety: Always wear protective helmets
while engaging in any activity that may put you at
risk of head or ear injuries. Change in pressure levels
inside the ear is potentially harmful, so use earplugs or
practise swallowing and yawning often during air travel,
especially during takeof and landing.
</p>
			<br/>
			
			<p>Not understanding what other people say and answering
inappropriately, diiculty hearing during conversations, ear
pain, and frequent hums/noise within your ears or head are
just a few of the tell-tale signs of imminent hearing problems.
Seek medical advice when you experience any of these.
Proper ear care will improve your overall health. Start today.
Improve the quality of your life by taking adequate care of
your ears.</p>
